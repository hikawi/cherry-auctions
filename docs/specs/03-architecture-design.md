# Engineering Spec 03: Architecture Design

## Summary

This document concerns the logical overview of the application's architecture,
including networking.

In scope topics:

- Deployment Tactics
- Project Structure
- Networking and DNS

## Project Structure

To keep it simple for the course, this uses a simple monolith Go application,
but split to be modular enough to be easy to maintain, as well as fast enough
to iterate with.

Project Stack:

- Frontend (SPA)
- Backend (Single Binary)
- Database (Local PostgreSQL)
- S3 Storage (Local RustFS)

### Frontend (Vue SPA)

For the frontend structure, the main structure as generated by Vue's creation tool
is as followed:

```
/
|-- e2e/ (End-to-End testing scripts, might or might not be used)
|-- public/ (Static files that should be served directly on the frontend, reserved for static assets)
|-- scripts/ (Scripts that may or may not be useful during development)
|-- src/ (The main source folder)
    |-- __tests__ (Component-level tests)
    |-- components (Components at any level using Vue SFCs)
    |-- pages (Top-level components that represent the entire Page under Router View)
    |-- router (Router config)
    |-- i18n (I18n config)
    |-- stores (In-memory stores for the entire application)
|-- index.html (Vite's mount source)
```

## Deployment Tactics

Frontend is deployed on Vercel to utilize their Edge Network and built-in CDN for
best latency to any user, while also seemingly to mitigate the latency from the
user to the backend hosted on [Netcup](https://netcup.com)
